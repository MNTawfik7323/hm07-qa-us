# Sprint 7 project
# Author: Michael Tawfik
# Used GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests locally to see how the Urban Grocers API functions
# Technologies used were VS Code, Git Bash, Node, Jest, Postman. As well as Swagger, and APIDoc for documentation souce
# Make sure to install package.json and jest in terminal before use
# variables were written in camelCase: actualStatusCode, actualResponseBody
# functions were names "let" and "const" 
# "let" is used if a function may have to be changed or deleted, "const" is used when that function will remain constant and not change
# Comments are used within the code to show and explain what the code is attempting and test names are added to further show expected results
## Note: One test within the deleteHandlers.js section fails. This is due to a bug
